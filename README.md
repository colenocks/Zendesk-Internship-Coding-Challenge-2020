# Getting Started with Zentickets

Zentickets is a Zendesk ticket viewer UI that connects to the Zendesk API using OAuth Authentication, requests all the tickets for my account and displays them in a list.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage Instructions

1. To successfully run this application on your machine, make sure no other application is running on port 3000.

2. In the project directory, you can run:

   ### `npm start`

   This automatically opens up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.

3. This takes you to an authorization page to all or deny access to retrieve tickets. Click allow to get access to the tickets.

4. After Authorization is successful, users will be brought to the screen below, to make requests to the Zendesk API, view all tickets and see each ticket in details as well.
